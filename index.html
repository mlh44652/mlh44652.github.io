<H3>You Could Be Doing This!</H3>
<p>Imagine living in your perfect paradise with no rules and regulations of society to hold you back.
Nothing but the feel of the ocean breeze and the smell of the salt water overpowering your nose.</p>
<p>No one to tell you what you are doing wrong, and no one trying to tell you to be someone you are not;
just your one true inner self and the waves.</p>
<p>Surfing may not be for everyone, but it is definitely something everyone should try in there lifetime. 
There is nothing more majestic and freeing than being in that wave and seeing the world through a translucent lense.</p>
<p>That's my idea of a utopia. What's yours?</p>
